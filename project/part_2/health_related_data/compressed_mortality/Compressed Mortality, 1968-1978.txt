Caveats:
"1. About sub-national population figures: population figures for 1968-69 are estimates derived by NCHS using linear"
"extrapolation; population figures for 1970 are April 1 modified census counts; and population figures for 1971-78 are"
"intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Population"
"Information."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"3. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"

"4. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#2000 Standard Population."
"5. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the number of live births"
"for the given time period. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"6. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
