Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"2. About population figures for regions, divisions, states and counties: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999"
"series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are"
"bridged-race April 1 census counts; population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race"

"estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016."
"3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
